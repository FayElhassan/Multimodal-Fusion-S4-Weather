## Python Code Description

This script provides an extensive framework for deep learning tasks, focusing on image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using PyTorch and associated libraries. It handles data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving results for different models including ResNet50, UNet, and ConvLSTM.

### Imports
- Common libraries for handling arrays, dataframes, and visualization (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
- Deep learning and image processing libraries (e.g., `torch`, `torchvision`, `PIL`).
- Machine learning utilities from `sklearn` for data splitting and performance metrics.
- Custom modules for specific network architectures (e.g., `layers`, `unet_parts`).

### Environment Setup
- Configures PyTorch for optimal performance on available hardware (GPU or Apple's MPS).
- Defines transformations for image preprocessing.

### Data Preparation
- Functions to collect image paths and load datasets into PyTorch `DataLoader`s.
- Data is split into training, validation, and test sets, and loaded with specified transformations.

### Model Training
- Multiple models are prepared and trained:
  - **ResNet50** for basic image classification or regression tasks.
  - **UNet** tailored for image segmentation tasks.
  - **ConvLSTM** designed for sequential image data processing.
- Training function includes detailed logs and supports gradient accumulation for effective memory management.

### Evaluation and Reporting
- Functions to evaluate model performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.
- Additional evaluation for classification tasks includes ROC curves and confusion matrices.
- Results are saved both graphically and textually.

### Utility Functions
- Includes utilities for displaying images with predictions, generating detailed classification reports, and managing large datasets efficiently.

### Usage
This script is structured to be highly modular, suitable for various deep learning tasks involving image data. It facilitates easy switching between different models and tasks, making it ideal for experimental setups and research.

### Notes
- The script assumes the existence of certain directories and files, with paths defined at the beginning of the script.
- It heavily utilizes command-line arguments for configuration, making it flexible for batch processing and automation in research environments.
