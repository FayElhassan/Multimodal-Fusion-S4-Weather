# Multimodal-Fusion-S4-Weather

This repository implements a **multimodal data fusion** framework combined with **contrastive self-supervised learning** for enhanced weather forecasting. The core of the approach utilizes **S4 models** to capture both short- and long-term temporal dependencies across diverse datasets, including radar images, structured weather data, and forecast models.

### Key Features
- **Multimodal Data Fusion**: Combines data from various sources (e.g., Open Meteo, Open Weather, and measurement datasets) to enhance forecasting accuracy.
- **S4 Models**: Efficient state-space models for temporal dependency modeling, excelling in both short-term (sequence length 169) and long-term (sequence length 1024) forecasts.
- **Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning**: Improves feature representations by leveraging unlabeled data.
- **Robust Performance**: Achieves low RMSE values across key weather variables such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and irradiance.

### Applications
- **Agriculture**: Accurate weather predictions for crop management.
- **Disaster Management**: Early detection of extreme weather events.
- **Renewable Energy**: Optimizing energy generation based on weather conditions.
