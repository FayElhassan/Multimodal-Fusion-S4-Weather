## Python Code Description

This script identifies and segregates images with a significant amount of black pixels from a directory. It processes images, calculates the percentage of black pixels, and moves images exceeding a specified threshold to a designated folder. The results, including image names and their black percentage, are recorded in a CSV file.

### Imports
- `os`: Interface with the operating system for file path manipulations.
- `shutil`: Offers high-level file operations like moving files.
- `sys`: Accesses system-specific parameters, such as command line arguments.
- `PIL (Python Imaging Library)`: Used for opening and manipulating images.
- `numpy`: Supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.

### Global Settings
- `ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True`: Allows the loading of images that are truncated.

### Directory Setup
- `root_dir`: Base directory path obtained from the first command line argument.
- `original_images_dir`: Directory containing the original images.
- `black_images_dir`: Target directory for images with excessive black areas. Created if it does not exist.

### Thresholds
- `black_threshold`: Defines the minimum percentage of black pixels required for an image to be considered for moving.

### Functions

#### `calculate_black_percentage(image_path)`
Calculates the percentage of black pixels in an image:
- Opens an image and converts it to grayscale.
- Calculates the ratio of black pixels to the total number of pixels, multiplying by 100 for percentage.

#### `main()`
Main function that orchestrates the script:
- Enumerates through all images in the `original_images_dir`.
- Calculates the black pixel percentage for each image.
- Moves images with a black pixel percentage above the `black_threshold` to `black_images_dir`.
- Compiles data into a pandas DataFrame and saves it as a CSV file in the root directory.

### Entry Point
- The script is intended to run as a standalone script, activated by the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, taking a directory path as a command line argument.

### Usage
Ideal for preprocessing image data, especially for applications where the background or content's color distribution is a factor, such as automated image sorting or preprocessing for computer vision tasks.
